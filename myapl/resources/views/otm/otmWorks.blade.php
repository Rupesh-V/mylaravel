    <p class="para">Optimized Translational Medicine (OTM) is an emerging organization in the healthcare space which aims to directly apply relevant medical research to clinical practice, bridging the gap between bench and bedside. We utilize an extensive network of expert consultants in multiples fields in building our comprehensive patient care model consisting of conventional and unconventional diagnostics and treatments for irritable bowel syndrome. Our contributors include research PhDs, professors, clinical MDs, nutritionists, and lifestyle coaches in order to aggregate the most diverse information possible.<span id="dots" class="para"></span><span id="more" class="para" style="display: none;">Even the best doctors are unable to treat all of their patients' gastrointestinal problems because of the labor intensive nature of their profession and the multifactorial nature of gastrointestinal disorders. That's where we come in. OTM will be there to work with doctors of all kinds to provide diagnostics and treatment options for patients suffering with irritable bowel syndrome from both our patient care model, and by working with our PhDs on a patient by patient basis. The more we discover what works and what doesn't work for different patients, the more efficacious our model becomes.

      OTM starts by contracting with a doctor, then the doctor offers our services to his/her patients. If the patient is interested in OTM, they can fill out our patient questionnaire, and their doctor can send us some preliminary patient data. From there, we draw from the reccomendations of OTM's team of consultants and our patient care model, creating a comprehensive report that will be sent to the doctor and can be shared with the patient. Doctors can then do any diagnostics or treatments "in house" they can, while other options may require external support from OTM through its consultants or website. Whether it is purchasing high quality supplements from our website, virtually meeting with an OTM nutrition coach, or visiting a nearby facility for further testing or procedures, our report will clearly outline the next steps for the patient. OTM expects to assist patients with followups based on the progression of their symptoms to allow patients to ameliorate gastrointestinal distress.</span><br>
